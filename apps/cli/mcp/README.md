# BoxLite MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server

BoxLite MCP Server allows AI agents to utilize:

- BoxLite Box Management (Create, Destroy)
- Execute commands in BoxLite Boxes
- File Operations in BoxLite boxes
- Generate preview links for web applications running in BoxLite Boxes

## Prerequisites

- BoxLite account
- BoxLite CLI installed
- A compatible AI agent (Claude Desktop App, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)

## Steps to Integrate BoxLite MCP Server with an AI Agent

1. **Install the BoxLite CLI:**

**Mac/Linux**

```bash
brew install boxlite-ai/cli/boxlite
```

**Windows**

```bash
powershell -Command "irm https://get.boxlite.io/windows | iex"
```

2. **Log in to your BoxLite account:**

```bash
boxlite login
```

3. **Initialize the BoxLite MCP server with Claude Desktop/Claude Code/Cursor/Windsurf:**

```bash
boxlite mcp init [claude/cursor/windsurf]
```

4. **Open Agent App**

## Integrating with Other AI Agents Apps

**Run the following command to get a JSON BoxLite MCP configuration which you can c/p to your agent configuration:**

```bash
boxlite mcp config
```

**Command outputs the following:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "boxlite-mcp": {
      "command": "boxlite",
      "args": ["mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "HOME": "${HOME}",
        "PATH": "${HOME}:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin"
      },
      "logFile": "${HOME}/Library/Logs/boxlite/boxlite-mcp-server.log"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: if you are running BoxLite MCP Server on Windows OS, add the following to the env field of the configuration:

```json
"APPDATA": "${APPDATA}"
```

**Finally, open or restart your AI agent**
