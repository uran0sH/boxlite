//! Network backend abstraction for Boxes.
//!
//! This module provides a trait-based architecture for pluggable network backends,
//! allowing different net implementations (libslirp, gvproxy, passt, etc.) to be
//! used without changing engine code.
//!
//! When no backend is configured (None), the engine uses its default net
//! implementation.
