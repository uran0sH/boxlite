    Provides the _sync() method that bridges async to sync using greenlet

    How it works:
        1. User calls a sync method (e.g., box.run_command())
        2. Sync method calls _sync(async_coro)
        3. _sync() creates an asyncio task and switches to dispatcher fiber
        4. Dispatcher fiber runs event loop, processes the task
        5. When task completes, callback switches back to user fiber
        6. _sync() returns the task result
